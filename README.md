# emacs.d

My Emacs config for rails develop

## Introduction

Add
```
alias emacs="emacs -nw"
alias ec="emacsclient -nw"
alias ed="emacs --daemon"
```
in .zshrc

Add `emacs --daemon` to login script. And next use "ec" to open emacs, this will fast open emacsðŸ˜ƒ

I most suggestion familiar with [projectile-rails](https://github.com/asok/projectile-rails). It will fast open rails file in MVC mode.

[swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) will short you search way.

I use [company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode) for autocomplete.

And my theme is [dracula](https://draculatheme.com/emacs/). It's purple color so amazing!
